Add Final Boss stage, where you play a normal round, then there is an animation where he's all like you cannot beat me alone, and Penguin says something
along the lines of "I'm not alone" and then all the gray / maybe blue, penguins show up, then you play a minigame where all you have to do is spam tap
on the screen.  After you've accumalated enough, then it goes to a cut scene, where Penguin is basically Captain falcon, the music plays (from cpt
falcon) and then he attacks, and penguin loses his hat (to reveal brown hair underneath), and then they explode in some weird explosion thing, and then the
music fades away, and it fades in saying, "thank you for playing."
